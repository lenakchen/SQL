AGGREGATE QUERIES

* for each bar, count the number of drinkers that frequent that bar
  and that like both 'heineken' and 'bud'


select x.bar, count(distinct x.drinker)
from frequents x, likes y, likes z
where x.drinker = y.drinker and x.drinker = z.drinker
  and y.beer = 'heineken' and z.beer = 'bud'
group by x.bar


* for each bar that serve both 'heineken' and 'bud' count the number
  of drinkers that frequent that bar

select x.bar, count(distinct x.drinker)
from frequents x, serves y, serves z
where x.bar = y.bar and x.bar = z.bar
  and y.beer = 'heineken' and z.beer = 'bud'
group by x.bar


* for each bar that serve 'heineken' count the number of drinkers that
  frequent that bar and that like 'bud'

select x.bar, count(distinct x.drinker)
from frequents x, serves y, likes z
where x.bar = y.bar and x.drinker = z.drinker
  and y.beer = 'heineken' and z.beer = 'bud'
