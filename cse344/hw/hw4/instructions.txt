Saxon Instructions (Linux+Java only)
=====================================================================
Saxon comes in Java or .NET versions. The documentation for the command 
line version of either is available at:
http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/using-xquery/commandline.xml
To download either version navigate to: http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/
(The instructions below will download saxon Java version from
scratch).

Create a directory for the assignment and cd into that directory, then do the following:

0.  Open a text editor of your own choice and save the following in q1.xq (uptil the end of </result>):
    <result>
      { 
          for $x in doc("mondial.xml")/mondial/country//city/name/text()
	  return <c> { $x } </c>
      }
    </result>
   Similarly save the following in q2.xq.
     <answer>
       { 
           for $x in doc("mondial.xml")/mondial/country[normalize-space(name)="Peru"]/province[count(city)>1]/name
	   return <big-province> { fn:string($x) } </big-province>
       }
     </answer>
   
     (: Comment :)
     (: !!! Note: Using "fn:string" is because $x is an attribute. This
        is one way to return the value of an attribute.
		
		The normalize-space function takes any non-single-space 
		whitespace (newline, tab, consecutive spaces, etc) and replaces them
		with a single space, and removes all leading and trailing spaces.
		You may want to consider using this function when dealing with 
		strings you cannot control (like strings from variables).
