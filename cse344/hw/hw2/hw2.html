<p>	
In this homework, you will write several SQL queries on a relational
movie database. The data in this database is from the IMDB website. 
The database consists of six tables:

<blockquote><p>
	<b>ACTOR</b> (id, fname, lname, gender)<br>
	<b>MOVIE</b> (id, name, year)<br>
	<b>DIRECTORS</b> (id, fname, lname)<br>
	<b>CASTS</b> (pid, mid, role)<br>
	<b>MOVIE_DIRECTORS</b> (did, mid)<br>
	<b>GENRE</b> (mid, genre)<br>
	<p>All <tt>id</tt> fields are integers. Movie.year is also an integer. All other fields are character strings. You can use either <tt>text</tt> or <tt>varchar(xx)</tt> for the character strings (people's names have maximum 30 characters, roles and genres have maximum 50, and movie titles have maximum 150). You should define the <tt>gender</tt> field to be one single character long.<br>
	  <br>
	  In addition, impose the following constraints:<br>
    <strong>ACTOR.</strong>id<strong>, MOVIE.</strong>id<strong>, DIRECTOR.</strong>id = primary keys of the corresponding tables<br>
	<b>CASTS</b>.pid  = foreign key to <b>ACTOR</b>.id<br>
	<b>CASTS</b>.mid, <b>MOVIE_DIRECTORS</b>.mid= foreign keys to <b>MOVIE</b>.id<br>
	Interestingly, the IMDB dataset is not perfectly clean and some entries in <b>GENRE</b>.mid refer to non-existing movies. While we could clean-up the dataset, we chose to leave it unchanged to point-out that dirty data is a huge problem in practice.<br>
	In this assignment, simply do not specify that GENRE.mid is a foreign key. If you do, the data will fail to load.
  <b>MOVIE_DIRECTORS</b>.did = foreign key to <b>DIRECTORS</b>.id
</blockquote>

<p>
We provide the movie database as a set of plain-text data files
in the linked .tar.gz archive.
Each file in this archive contains all the rows
for the named table, one row per line.

<p>
In this homework, you need to do three things: (A) import the movie dataset into
SQLite, (B) create indexes on the data to make the queries run fast, and (C) run SQL queries to answer a set of questions about the data.
<h4>A. IMPORTING THE IMDB DATABASE (10 points):</h4>
<p>
To import the movie database into SQLite, you will need to run <code>sqlite3</code>
with a new database file: for example &quot;<strong>sqlite3 myhw2</strong>&quot;.  Then you can use the <code>CREATE TABLE</code>
SQL statement to create the tables, choosing appropriate types for each
column and specifying all key constraints as described above:
<pre>
	CREATE TABLE table_name (  . . . );
</pre>
<p>Currently, SQLite does not enforce foreign keys by default. To enable foreign keys use the following command. The command will have no effect if your version of SQLite was not compiled with foreign keys enabled. Do not worry about it.
<pre>
    PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;
</pre>

<p>Then, you can use the SQLite <code>.import</code> command to read data from
  each text file into its table:

<pre>	.import filename tablename
</pre>
<p>See examples of .<tt>import</tt> statements in the lecture notes, and also look at the SQLite documentation or <code>sqlite3</code>'s <code>.help</code> for details.
  
<p>
Put all the code for part A (six <tt>create table</tt> statements and six .<tt>import</tt> statements) into a file called <code>create-tables.sql</code> .


<h4>B. CHOOSING INDEXES (40 points):</h4>
<p>
NOTE: you may want to start working on C first, then return to B.<br>
<br>
Once you have imported the movie database, 
  your main task is to write SQL queries (task C below).
  However, you will find that even simple queries will take a long time;
  this is because the movie database you created
  lacks indexes on frequently accessed columns of its tables.
<p>
Hence, you will need to choose indexes for the movie database 
and create them using SQLite's <code>CREATE INDEX</code> SQL statement:
<pre>
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX index_name ON table_name(col_1, col_2, ...);
</pre>
<p>
If given, the optional keyword <code>UNIQUE</code> says that no row 
can exist in the table with duplicate values of all the index columns.  
If you did not mark those constraints already in the <code>CREATE TABLE</code>
statements, telling SQLite about them here may let it choose
a faster way to create and maintain the index, or to read through the 
indexed table when running a query.

<p>
Your goal is to choose up to about 10 indexes, such that once the indexes are
created, your queries for the questions below should not take more than 1 minute
on a modern computer.  
You have some flexibility about which indexes to choose, there is no absolutely perfect solution; our solution takes only about 15 seconds to run on a desktop machine from 2009,
using 11 indexes.
Be sure to create only indexes that matter.
<p>Before each CREATE INDEX statement write a one-line comment  with the reason for choosing each index (e.g. &quot;in order to speed up the selection in query 7&quot; or &quot;in order to speed up the join in query 11&quot;).
<p>Note that index creation can be a time consuming operation. 

<p>
  Put all your code for part B (<code>CREATE INDEX</code> code) in a file called 
  <code>create-indexes.sql</code>.<h4>C. SQL QUERIES (50 points; 10 points per question):</h4>
<p>
For each question below, write a single SQL query to answer that question.
Put your queries in a file called <code>hw2-queries.sql</code>. Add a comment to
each query indicating with the question it answers and the number of rows in the 
query result.

<ol>	
<li>
	<p>List the first and last names of all the actors who played in the
	movie 'Officer 444'. 
	<em> [~13 rows expected] </em>
 
<li> 
	<p>List all the directors who directed a <em>'Film-Noir' </em> 
	movie in a leap year.  (You need to check that the genre is 
	<em>'Film-Noir' </em> and simply assume that every year divisible by 4
	is a leap year.)  Your query should return director name, the movie name, 
	and the year.
	<em> [~113 rows] </em>

<li>
	<p>List all the actors who acted in a film before 1900 and
	also in a film after 2000.  (That is: &lt; 1900 and &gt; 2000.)
	<em> [~48 rows] </em>
	<p>
	How can this be? Actors can't live more than 100 years, right?
	Please find the explanation.  For that you need to
	investigate a bit, perhaps run 1-2 additional queries (include
	them in your <code>hw2-queries.sql</code> file).  Once you
	identify one logical explanation why some actors appear in movies
	more than 100 years apart, write it in your SQL code, as a
	comment to the SQL query; keep your answer below 1-2 sentences.

<li>
	<p>List all directors who directed 500 movies or more, in descending
	order of the number of movies they directed.  Return the directors'
	names and the number of movies each of them directed.
	<em> [~47 rows] </em>

<li>
	<p>We want to find actors that played five or more roles in the same
	movie during the year 2010.  Notice that <b>CASTS</b> may have occasional 
	duplicates, but we are not interested in these: we want actors that had 
	five or more <em>distinct</em> roles in the same movie in the year 2010.
	Write a query that returns the actors' names, the movie name,
	and the number of distinct roles that they played in that movie
	(which will be &ge; 5). 
	<em> [~24 rows] </em>  
</ol>
Put all your code for part C (<code>SELECT-FROM-WHERE</code> code) in a file called<code> hw2-queries.sql</code>.
<h4>NOTES:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
	Unless otherwise specified, in each question that asks you to return 
	all actors, or all directors, or all movies, you should return 
	their names (first and last for people).
<li>
	Each question lists a <em>suggested</em> number of rows returned 
	for a correct query.  If your query produces a slightly different
	number of rows, that does not necessarily mean that you made a mistake.
<li>Save all files you create during this homework: you will need them in later homeworks.
</ul>
